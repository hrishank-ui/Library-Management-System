# Library-Management-System

Created a basic terminal based Library Management System to strengthen my OOP concepts. AGAIN, it doesn't use all the 4 pillars of OOP, it still demonstrate fundamental concepts such as classes, encapsulation, constructors, methods, and basic data handling using Java collections.

To run this project, download these files and run it on any IDE.
